Hello there!

I'm a doctoral student in Computer Science at <img src="../assets/img/eth_short.png" alt="eth" height="20"/> [ETH Zürich](https://ethz.ch/en.html), Switzerland 🇨🇭, affiliated with [Computational Robotics Lab](http://crl.ethz.ch/), advised by <img src="../assets/img/eth_short.png" alt="eth" height="20"/> [Prof. Stelian Coros](http://crl.ethz.ch/people/coros/index.html) and <img src="../assets/img/cmu-lettermark-r.png" alt="cmu" height="10"/> [Prof. Guanya Shi](https://www.gshi.me/).

Prior to this, I received my master's degree in mechanical engineering at <img src="../assets/img/eth_short.png" alt="eth" height="20"/> [ETH Zürich](https://ethz.ch/en.html) and my bachelor's degree in vehicle engineering at <img src="../assets/img/thu_short.png" alt="eth" height="15"/> [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/).

#### - research

My research interest lies in empowering mobile robots with the ability of locomotion and manipulation through reinforcement learning. I mainly focus on legged systems such as quadrupeds 🐕🐈, humanoids 🏃🏻💃🏻.

#### - misc.

Other than professional bios, I am from [Chongqing](https://goo.gl/maps/dJPha9VP7CFDoNqg7), southwest of China.
I am extremely fond of [Chongqing hot pot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chongqing_hot_pot).

Besides, I love to read and spend a lot of time with books, especially in modern and contemporary literature.
My favorite authors are [Haruki Murakami](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haruki_Murakami), [Natsume Soseki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natsume_S%C5%8Dseki), [Albert Camus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Camus) and [Gabriel García Márquez](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabriel_Garc%C3%ADa_M%C3%A1rquez).

I also enjoy photography 📷, video games 🎮, and movies 🍿. In my free time, I make latte arts ☕️, play tennis 🎾, and snowboard 🏂.
