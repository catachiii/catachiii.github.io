⛰️ I spent a wonderful week at [ETH Robotics Summer School](https://robotics-summerschool.ethz.ch/) in Wangen an der Aare. A broad scope of components of autonomous mobile robots including state estimation, trajectory optimization, environment mapping, and artifact detection were introduced and implemented on a wheeled platform, [SuperMegaBot](https://unlimited.ethz.ch/display/ROBOTX/SuperMegaBot).
